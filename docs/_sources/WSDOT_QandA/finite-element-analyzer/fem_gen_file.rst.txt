Finite Element Analysis - File Generation
----------------------

The best way to create a F3D file is to use the FEA report file from a bridge analysis. 
Best to use a BDF file for a small bridge so the resulting FEA file is not to cumbersome to edit. 
Before doing a run, either LFR or LRFR, set the AnalysisControls switch "RptFEA" to "Y"

   :scale: 50%

The analysis will generate a ...._Fea.rpt file.
Rename the file to any name you want with the extension of ".f3d"

Now go to the next step of editing this file :ref:`fem_f3d_file`
