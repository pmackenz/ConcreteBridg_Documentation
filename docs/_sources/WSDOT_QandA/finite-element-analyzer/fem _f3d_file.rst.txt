Finite Element Analysis - The F3D file
----------------------

Edit the F3D file and cut out all but the F3D model input section. 

The F3D model begins with the section that begins with the "MATPROP" entry. 
It ends with the command "EvalAllMbrs". Between are all the F3D entry fields (see list below). 

Cut all BUT the F3D model from the file. This is now a run-able F3D file. 


A F3D input file has these sections. Each section is self documented in the F3D file.
