Conversion of Older BDF files to Latest Version
================================================

BRIDG has been backward compatible since version 8.2. The current version can read any BDF file since
then, but it always generates the most recent file format. Thus, the only supported method for conversion of
BDF files is to read in an older version file and then generate an "Input Only" report file. Rename the report
file from a RPT to a BDF and you now have a reliable conversion. Be careful to read any warnings or error
messages that might have been displayed during the conversion. These messages are saved in the .LOG file.
