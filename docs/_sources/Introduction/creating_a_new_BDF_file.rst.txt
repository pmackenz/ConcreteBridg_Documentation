How to create a new BDF file
===============================

The best way to create a new BDF file is to make a copy of an existing file that most closely matches the new
bridge configuration. If the file is from an older version of BRIDG then convert the file to the current revision
level before editing (See Conversion of BDF files). As a last resort, you can make a copy of the
TEMPLATE.BDF file. This file is completely blank except for some girder shapes, and truck configurations.

The TEMPLATE.BDF file contains all of the BRIDG data blocks, but you only need to include those required
for your bridge. Files that have been converted from an older version will also have most of the BRIDG data
blocks. A data block with no data entry lines is allowed, but they do clutter up the input file.

The BDF input file is a simple text file that you edit with any normal text editor. Using a Word processor is not
advised since these programs tend to include many hidden and special codes in the file that will upset
BRIDG. Also, the column positions in the BDF file are very important and most user input errors are a result of
not placing a value in the correct column. The best editor we have found for BRIDG files is Notepad that
comes standard with all version of Windows.

Rules for editing the BDF file:

• Do not edit the first line that states the revision level of the file.
• Do not cut and paste sections from files that have different revision levels.
• **DO NOT USE TABS**. Instruct your editor to expand tabs to spaces.
• Be careful not to move the data field markers. A good check is to produce an "input only" report and review it.
• Do have fun.
