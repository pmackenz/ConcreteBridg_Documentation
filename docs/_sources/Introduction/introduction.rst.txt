Introduction
==============

Bridg Version 10.9 builds on previous versions of Bridg. It adds the capability to rate concrete structures using
the Load Resistance Factor method per the latest Manual for Bridge Evaluation (MBE). It also maintains
capability of rating structures using the Load Factor Method. Engineers, who have used previous versions of
the software, should not see much of a change in the input. Few cards were added to capture the change in
the way Live Load Factors are calculated.

This manual is intended to complement the input file. Most of the data input are described within the cards;
hence, not all are described here.
